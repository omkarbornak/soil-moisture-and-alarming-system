automated soil moisture and alarming system using microcontroller.
A soil moisture sensor and alarming system using a microcontroller is a device that measures the moisture levels in soil and triggers an alarm when the levels fall below a certain threshold. The system typically consists of a soil moisture sensor, a microcontroller, and an alarm module.

The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture levels in the soil and sends the data to the microcontroller. The microcontroller then compares the data to a predefined threshold value and triggers the alarm if the moisture levels are too low.

The system can be used in various applications such as agriculture, gardening, and landscaping to ensure that plants receive adequate water. It can also be used to monitor soil moisture levels in real-time, allowing for more efficient irrigation management.
